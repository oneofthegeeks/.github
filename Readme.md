# .github

This is a special repository that provides default community health files and configurations for all repositories in the @oneofthegeeks organization.

## What's in this repository?

### FUNDING.yml
Default sponsorship configuration that applies to all repositories. This adds a "Sponsor" button to all repositories with the following options:
- GitHub Sponsors: [@oneofthegeeks](https://github.com/sponsors/oneofthegeeks)
- Buy Me A Coffee: [Oneofthegeeks](https://buymeacoffee.com/Oneofthegeeks)

## How it works

GitHub automatically uses files from this `.github` repository as defaults for all other repositories that don't have their own versions of these files.
